-- Gear scenarios for gear_matrix_spec.lua (docs/04-TESTING.md, ADR-0006 rule 6). Each scenario is
-- merged into a FakeState (tests/gear_matrix_spec.lua adds a default gcd = 1.5 unless the scenario
-- overrides it — without a nonzero GCD, Simulation's virtual clock never advances and every slot
-- after the first sees the same t=0, which produces meaningless "queues"). `expect` lists the exact
-- top-N spells/items Simulation.queue(build, state, 3) must produce; it may be shorter than 3 when
-- nothing else is castable — Simulation documents that it "shortens rather than repeating or
-- erroring" once every entry is exhausted, and gear_matrix_spec asserts the queue's real length.
--
-- Every `expect` here was hand-derived by walking Elmira_Paladin/Data/Builds/Paladin_Exodin.lua's
-- entries top-to-bottom against Engine.eligible + Simulation.applyCast's actual cooldown/resource
-- bookkeeping, not copied from whatever the engine happens to output — see the gear_matrix_spec.lua
-- report for the ones that changed from what was staged here before reconciliation.
